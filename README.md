# Welcome to the Shoper stop!

## Description 
The whole application is designed to demonstrate the concept of JAM STACK. Functionality wise, it shows an interface of shopping site which has a listing of product(PLP), each product can be viewed in the next page(PDP) and can be added into the cart. Now cart can display the total amount. This site also contains a gift card page that is rendered on CMS based content. 
 
## Jamstack
  JAMstack is a set of tools that can be used to build an ecosystem. There are three foundations(JAM- Javascript,A-API, M-Markup) that are more like conventions rather than a set of specific tools that you have to use to fit in the definition of the term JAMstack.
